0: 8 11
8: 42 | 42 8
11: 42 31 | 42 11 31

8 = (42)+
  that means as many repeations of 42 as needed

11 = 42 (11)? 31
  that means that 11 can repeat within itself

since 0 depends on 8 and 11
it's enough to find 31 & 42

then to check if a message is valid, we check either
8. if it's a repeation of 42
11. if it starts with 42 and ends with 31, then if the middle part satisifes this same rule

0 is 8 AND THEN 11, but since 8 ends with 42 and 11 starts with 42
it means 0: (42)+ (42)n (31)n





This problem reminded me of the course Formal Languages and Automata by Professor Marija Mihova
